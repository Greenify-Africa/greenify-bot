## We built with twitter api-v2 and v1 modules provided twitter via npm, using the filtered stream point

## Oauth2 authentication was a real pain, and also trying to do webhooks and quick replies...

we couldn't really flow because we had no prior experience with the twitter-api

## We built a bot that retweets other people's tweets about Greenify to spead the word, this is so cool!

## When Patience and Diligence is applied nothing can stop us, not even obscure docs

## Greenify bot is also powered by a cron job based interface that helps us to schedule posts at a specific time... Our bot will monitor all users who make testimonials on twitter to help us promote our product.
